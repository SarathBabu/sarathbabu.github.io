A simple python script to genearte the generic icons for android applications. You don't need any online application and downloding of archives and extraction. You can simply use this script to generate icons fron PNG images with which ever size (dpi value) you need and the color you like. You can also specify padding on the icon (dpi value) if you want. All you are left to do is simple copy paste the drawable folders into the project directory.

Just think how many times you need to change the size and/or color of icons in your application while development. If you depend on an online application it will be a boring task of uploading and downloading and extracting.
