This project is intent to help developer to reduce the code in their project and make development
easy. So I added basic functional requirements that are generally needed in many application in
to this application. These functional requirements are in following areas

  - Runtime Permissions on devices with Android versions above Lollipop.
  - Database schema generation and updation.
  - Getting updates on connectivity status
  - Developing location aware applications.

This library encapsulates all these functionalities and developers can add this into their project
using gradle.
