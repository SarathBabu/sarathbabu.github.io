This android library will lessen your soding efforts to do SQLite database migration, Requesting runtime pemission on devices with Android operating system following Lollipop, Runtime tracking the netwok status change. All these are usual coding requirements in an Android application development, it true that we all are already femiliar with these operations an wrote code manytime for these operations.

My effort is to make these functionalities(and many others in future) into a single resusable package which can be easily interated into the applications.
